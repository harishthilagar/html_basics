      <p>Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces the world as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our daily needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all derive their basic components from nature.</p>
      <p>Great lengths of mountains, thriving ecosystems, the ever-spreading sky together with the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere create a saga called “Nature”. Rich both in terms of its scenic beauty and replenishing resources, nature accounts for supporting life in different shapes and forms on our planet.</p>
      <p>It can be said that nature drives the process of converting everything that is natural on earth into most of the things that are artificial. Nature also maintains the continuity between the different spheres on Earth. Owing to the multiple elements obtained from nature, with a growing population, the need to meet demands is increasing every day. At an equal pace is rising the level of air, water, soil and noise pollution as a result of the universal dependence on technology.</p>
      <p>Every member of the living world obtains its life support from nature. Nature guides the cycling of air, water and life between the different constituents or spheres on Earth. The treasures in nature not only provide for our basic requirements of survival but also fuel the raw materials to support factories and industries on which the modern world primarily runs.
      </p> 
      <p>Since the population is increasing at an exponential rate largely in India and many parts of the world, the “use” of resources has now turned to depletion. Adding to this, are the excessive levels of atmospheric and environmental pollution. Industrial wastes, unchecked use of vehicles, illegal cutting of trees, poaching of animals, nuclear power plants and many more are contributing to the disruption of the natural systems and global warming.
      </p>
      <p>Student clubs, organizations and the government have taken measures to curb the exhaustion of nature and extinction of the life it supports. Some of these include:

      </p>Adapting sustainable modes of survival
          Conserving all forms of energy
          Limiting the use of vehicles that release pollutants
          Mass afforestation in different areas
          Implementing methods to meet the minimums tree cover required
          Switching to organic agriculture as much as possible
          Reusing and recycling goods
          Spreading awareness among people near us</p> 
       <p>History is a witness to the extinction of organisms as large as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as minute as ants.</p>
